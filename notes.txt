🔹 OOPS Concepts 

1. Class

   . Class is a blueprint (design) of an object.

   . Example: A "Car" class can have properties like color, model, speed, and methods like drive(), brake().

2. Object

   . Object is a real entity created from a class.

   . Example: Car myCar = new Car(); → myCar is an object of the class Car.

3. Encapsulation

  . Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together in a single unit (class).

  . Example: In a bank account class, balance is private, but we access it using deposit() and withdraw() methods.

4. Abstraction

  . Hiding implementation details and showing only important features.

  . Example: When you drive a car, you only use steering, brakes, accelerator. You don’t know the internal engine working.

5. Inheritance

  . One class can inherit properties and methods of another class.

  . Example: Dog class inherits from Animal class.

  . Animal → eat(), sleep()

  . Dog → bark() + (eat, sleep from Animal)

6. Polymorphism (Poly = many, Morph = forms)

  . One thing can have many forms.

  *Two types:

    . Compile-time (Overloading) → same method name, different parameters.

    . Runtime (Overriding) → same method name in parent & child class, but child gives its own implementation

🔹 OOPS Interview Questions 

Q. What is OOPs?

  . OOPs is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects to structure code.

Q. What is the difference between class and object?

  . Class is a blueprint, object is an instance of the class.

Q. What is encapsulation?

  . Encapsulation is binding data and methods together, usually by making variables private and accessing them through getters/setters.

Q. What is abstraction?

  . Abstraction hides internal details and shows only essential features.

Q. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?

  . Abstraction → Hides "implementation details".

  . Encapsulation → Hides "data" using private variables.

Q. What is inheritance?

  . Inheritance allows one class (child) to use the properties and methods of another class (parent).

Q. What is polymorphism?

  . Ability of an object to take many forms (method overloading & method overriding).

Q. What is method overloading vs overriding?

  . Overloading → same method name, different parameters (compile-time).

  . Overriding → child class redefines parent’s method (runtime).

Q. What are access modifiers in OOPs?

  . public, private, protected, default → control how data/methods can be accessed.

Q. Why do we use OOPs?

  . Reusability, maintainability, scalability, and better code structure.

Q. What are access modifiers in OOPs?

(1) Quick summary (what they do)

   . public — accessible everywhere (inside class, outside, derived).
     (public → har jagah access)

   . private — accessible only inside the same class (and friends).
     (private → sirf usi class ke andar)

   . protected — accessible inside the class and in derived (child) classes, but not via objects from outside.
     (protected → class + derived classes)

   . default — C++: no explicit keyword; members default to private inside class and public inside struct.
    . Java: default (package-private) means accessible only inside the same package — C++ does not have Java-style package-default.

Modifier	Accessible in class	    Accessible in derived	    Accessible outside	   Best for

1. public	           ✅	             ✅	                     ✅	                    APIs, functions meant for everyone
2. private	           ✅	             ❌	                     ❌	                    Sensitive data, encapsulation
3. protected	       ✅	             ✅	                     ❌	                    Inheritance, frameworks
4. default (class)	   ✅ (private)	     ❌	                     ❌	                    Safety (if forgot keyword)
.  default (struct)	✅ (public)	         ✅	                     ✅	                    Simple data structures
