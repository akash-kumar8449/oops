• OOPs
  - What is it?
    👉 OOPs = Object Oriented Programming System, a way to organize code using classes and objects.
  - Purpose / How it helps:
    • Organize code in real-world terms (Car, Student, Bank Account).
    • Easy to reuse, scale, and maintain.
  - Advantages:
    • Real-world modeling.
    • Reusability of code.
    • Better security (encapsulation).
    • Polymorphism gives flexibility.
  - Disadvantages:
    • More memory & complexity (compared to procedural programming).
    • Learning curve is higher.
  - Why use?
    👉 Best for large projects where structure & reusability matter.
    👉 Better than procedural (C) when we need modularity.
  

• Class vs Object
  - What is it?
    • Class = blueprint/design.
    • Object = real entity created from class.
  - Purpose:
    • Class organizes structure; object represents real-world data.
  - Advantages:
    • Class → reusability.
    • Object → multiple instances with different data.
  - Disadvantages:
    • Need memory for each object.
    • Without objects, classes are useless.
  - Why use?
    👉 Needed to create real-world models in OOPs.
    👉 Objects make classes practical.
  -Real-time example:
    👉 Car manufacturing industry → "Car" is a class, and BMW, Audi, Tesla are objects.
  -Why used in industry:
    .Helps in modular design (हर चीज़ को अलग class में रखना)
    .Reusability → एक ही class से multiple objects बना सकते हैं।

• Encapsulation
  - What is it?
    👉 Binding data + methods together; hide data using private and access with getters/setters.
  - Purpose:
    • Protect sensitive data (like bank balance).
    • Provide controlled access.
  - Advantages:
    • Data security.
    • Prevents accidental changes.
    • Easy to maintain.
  - Disadvantages:
    • Extra code (getters/setters).
    • Slightly less flexible than public access.
  - Why use?
    👉 Best when data must be protected.
    👉 Better than abstraction when goal is data security.
  - Real-time example:
    👉 In Banking system – You can’t directly access balance (private), you can only use deposit() or withdraw() methods.
  - Why used in industry:
    . Improves security.
    . Data consistency maintained.

• Abstraction
  - What is it?
    👉 Hiding internal implementation, showing only features.
  - Purpose:
    • Reduce complexity for user.
    • Example: Car driver uses steering, brake — engine internals hidden.
  - Advantages:
    • User-friendly.
    • Focus on essentials, ignore unnecessary details.
  - Disadvantages:
    • Implementation complexity hidden → harder for debugging.
    • Sometimes hides too much.
  - Why use?
    👉 Best when we need simplicity for user.
    👉 Better than encapsulation for hiding logic/implementation.
  -Real-time example:
    👉 ATM Machine → You don’t know how internally money is processed, you just use withdraw() or checkBalance().
  - Why used in industry:
    . Reduces complexity.
    . Focus only on "what to do", not "how to do".

• Encapsulation vs Abstraction
  - Encapsulation → Hides data (variables) inside class.
  - Abstraction → Hides internal process, shows only necessary functions.
  👉 Both work together:
    • Encapsulation = security,
    • Abstraction = simplicity.

• Inheritance
  - What is it?
    👉 One class (child) reuses another class’s (parent) properties & methods.
  - Purpose:
    • Code reusability.
    • “Is-a” relationship modeling.
  - Advantages:
    • Reduces code duplication.
    • Easier extension of functionality.
  - Disadvantages:
    • Tight coupling → child depends on parent.
    • Misuse leads to fragile hierarchy.
  - Why use?
    👉 Best for hierarchies (Animal → Dog, Cat).
    👉 Better than writing code separately every time.

• Polymorphism
  - What is it?
    👉 One thing, many forms.
    • Compile-time: Method Overloading.
    • Runtime: Method Overriding.
  - Purpose:
    • Flexibility in code.
    • Same method name, different behavior.
  - Advantages:
    • Improves readability.
    • Extensible.
  - Disadvantages:
    • Can confuse beginners.
    • Debugging errors in overriding may be tricky.
  - Why use?
    👉 Best for flexible design.
    👉 Better than inheritance alone (because it adapts behavior).

• Method Overloading vs Overriding
  - Overloading:
    • Compile-time.
    • Same name, different parameters.
    • Advantage → readability, multiple versions of same logic.
    • Disadvantage → not dynamic, fixed at compile time.
  - Overriding:
    • Runtime.
    • Child class redefines parent’s method.
    • Advantage → flexibility, polymorphism.
    • Disadvantage → can cause bugs if logic wrongly overridden.
  👉 Overloading = convenience, Overriding = flexibility.

• Access Modifiers
  - What is it?
    👉 Keywords that control who can access data/methods: public, private, protected, default.
  - Purpose:
    • Security & controlled access.
  - Advantages:
    • Ensures correct usage of data.
    • Helps in encapsulation & abstraction.
  - Disadvantages:
    • Wrong choice of modifier → misuse.
    • Over-restrictive → code harder to extend.
  - Why use?
    👉 Best for defining clear API boundaries.
    👉 Better than no modifiers (procedural code).

• Why use OOPs?
  - Advantages:
    • Reusability, maintainability, scalability, modularity.
    • Security (private data).
    • Flexibility (polymorphism).
  - Disadvantages:
    • More memory usage.
    • Slightly slower than procedural (function calls, objects).
    • Harder to learn for beginners.
  - Why best?
    👉 For big projects, real-world modeling, and teamwork, OOPs is much better than procedural programming.
